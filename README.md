Welcome to the Parallax Scrolling Project! This repository contains a simple yet elegant implementation of parallax scrolling, a popular web design technique where background images move slower than the foreground images, creating an illusion of depth and immersion.
To customize the parallax scrolling effect, you can modify the following files:
index.html: Update the HTML structure and content.
styles.css: Change the styles and background images.
